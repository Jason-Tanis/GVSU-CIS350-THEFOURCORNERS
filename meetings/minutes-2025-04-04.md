Team name: The Four Corners

Members present: Jason, Kelsey, Sam, Tony

Date: 04-04-2025

Time: 2:00 PM - 2:30 PM

Discussion points:

* TA was present at beginning of meeting
* Ideally, we should be done with implementation and our test script by the middle of next week
* After implementation/test script, we need to write the documentation for our project (with screenshots)
* We ran the app in dev mode and discovered several bugs:
  * The loan planner has no "back" buttons
  * The loan planner allows the user to pass values of "0" for both "Total Loan Amount" and "APR"
  * The loan planner allows the user to press "Compute!" infinitely many times
  * The Sign Up screen allows the user to sign up without filling in every input field
  * A dialog box should be added to the budget creation screen notifying the user that they can't save more than one budget for the same month in the same year (e.g., can't have 2 March 2025 budgets)

Goals for next week (include responsibilities)

* Jason: Write test cases for Income/Expense feature, debug Sign Up screen and budget creation screen
* Tony: Continue writing test cases for the other features of the app
* Sam: Fix the bugs in the loan planner and complete its implementation
* Kelsey: Implement the history feature
