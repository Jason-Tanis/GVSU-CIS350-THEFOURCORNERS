Team name: The Four Corners

Members present: Jason, Sam, Tony

Date: 02-21-2025

Time: 2:00 PM - 2:45 PM

Discussion points:

* We first walked the TA through the progress we have made on our project
  * UI design in Figma and BeeWare implementation
* The TA walked us through the requirements of the presentation we are to give on Thursday, Feb. 28th
  1. Introduce individual team members and team name
  2. Explain the purpose of our app/the problem it is meant to solve (we must be concise with this)
  3. Explain the functionality of the app (i.e., what can the user do with it, and how?)
  4. Explain the coding language(s) used to develop the app, AND the database system being used
     - The database must be used to store user login info, and the budget(s) they've saved
     - We plan to use SQL as our database software
     - Jason and Sam volunteered to take on the role of database creation/integration with main app
  5. Show screenshots of Figma UI design, Jira board, and app running in dev mode
     - Also, briefly describe the Scrum meetings we've had (this is our fifth Scrum meeting)
  6. Show a Gantt chart that summarizes the information on the Jira board
     - i.e., # of tasks to-do, # of tasks in-progress, and # of tasks complete
     - Also include percentages (e.g., what % of tasks are complete?)

Goals for next week (include responsibilities)

* Continue implementing UI in BeeWare
* Begin creating a database
  - Database should have several tables: e.g., a table for User Login info, and a table for Budget Info
* Begin working on our slideshow
* Revise the team member roles defined in the GitHub repo so that they are more accurate
  - e.g., Jason is now Project Manager, Database Manager, and Developer
* Meet as a team on Tuesday, February 25th @ 1:00 PM in the library to discuss our presentation
