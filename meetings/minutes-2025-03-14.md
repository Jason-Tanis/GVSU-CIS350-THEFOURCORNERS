Team name: The Four Corners

Members present: Jason, Kelsey, Sam, Tony

Date: 03-14-2025

Time: 2:00 PM - 2:30 PM

Discussion points:

* Kelsey created our MySQL database; it is publicly available and stored in AWS
  - All information for accessing the database (i.e., hostname, port, username, and password) are in the Python script
  - For an unknown reason, it is currently impossible to connect to the database
* Until the database connection issue is resolved, we can only perform the following tasks:
  - Manually test the input fields for creating a budget
  - Implement the Loan Payment Planner feature
  - Implement the Log In/Sign Up GUI

Goals for next week (include responsibilities)

* Kelsey will reach out to one of her old professors who may be able to help resolve the database connection error
* Sam will complete the implementation of the Loan Payment Planner feature
* Tony will manually test the budget creation input fields
* Jason will implement the Log In/Sign Up GUI
