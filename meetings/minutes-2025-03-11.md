Team name: The Four Corners

Members present: Jason, Kelsey, Sam, Tony

Date: 03-11-2025

Time: 1:00 PM - 2:00 PM

Discussion points:

* When the user presses "Save Budget", data is currently saved to the database
  - However, the saved databases do not print when you return to the home screen
* Kelsey updated the code that creates the database (i.e., the create_database() function) so that it now uses MySQL instead of SQLite
  - The code that saves a newly created budget into the database has yet to be updated
* Kelsey and Sam discussed the structure of the database
  - Kelsey drew a diagram of the database and shared it in the Slack group chat for us to reference as needed
* For now, we are using Aurora DSQL as the remote server for our database
  - Kelsey created a remote server under her student email account
* Kelsey to take on the role of lead database manager (previously Jason's role); Sam to be assistant database manager


Goals for next week (include responsibilities)

* Tony to begin looking into creating unit tests for our project
* AuroraDSQL uses PostgreSQL; Kelsey to see if it can be changed to MySQL so that it is consistent with the Python code
* Jason to prototype Loan Calculation feature in Figma
* Sam and Jason to implement the Loan Calculation feature
