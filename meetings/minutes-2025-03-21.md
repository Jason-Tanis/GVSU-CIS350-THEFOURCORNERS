Discussion points:

* Showed Finnette a demo of our app
  - The database is stored on Kelsey's computer, and the connection is working
* Finnete wants us to modify the "Profile" screen of the app so that it shows the user's name and username
  - We should also add a logout button
* Finnete told us about the manual testing procedure we should follow
  - We need to make a test script in Excel
  - We need to perform "regression testing": every time we make an update to our app's code, we need to...
    - Make a new user profile (using 'Sign Up')
    - Conduct all the tests included in our test script to ensure they still pass
* We explained our current database setup to Finnete (i.e., why we needed to make it run on Kelsey's computer) 

Goals for next week (include responsibilities)

* Sam will continue implementing the Loan Payment Planner feature
* Tony will update the profile screen per Finnette's request
