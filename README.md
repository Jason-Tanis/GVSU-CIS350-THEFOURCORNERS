# Degree Dollars — The Four Corners

Degree Dollars is a cross-platform budgeting application designed for college students to better manage their money. Built with BeeWare’s Toga framework and a MySQL backend, the app allows users to plan monthly budgets, record real-time income and expenses, and visualize their financial activity. It also features a student loan planner that calculates either the required monthly payment or the time needed to pay off a loan. With student-friendly UI design and modular features, Degree Dollars supports all major platforms — desktop, mobile, and web.
