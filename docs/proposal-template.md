# Introduction

College students must cover a variety of expenses both while they are in school (e.g., tuition, housing, textbooks, food/groceries) and after they graduate (primarily in the form of student loans). It would be highly beneficial if they had a quick and easy way to record their anticipated expenses before a given month, track their actual cash flow (i.e., income and expenses) throughout the semester, and even come up with student loan payment strategies. Degree Dollars, developed by The Four Corners, provides these very services to both undergraduate and graduate students.

When coming up on a new month of college, a student can use Degree Dollars to record the dollar amounts they plan to spend in five (5) predefined categories: "Eductation," "Housing/Utilities," "Food," "Transportation", and "Entertainment". The student may also add additional categories if they choose. Each category may have infinitely many user-defined subcategories in which the dollar amounts are entered. For example, the student may add a "Gas" subcategory to the "Transportation" category and enter $50.00 into it. The given dollar amounts would serve as the student's initial budget for the month. Then, throughout the month, the student can record their actual spending in each subcategory. These spending amounts are automatically subtracted from the planned amounts. Should the student receive any income during the month, they can also add that income to any subcategories they choose (e.g., the student receives $300.00; they add it to the "Groceries" subcategory in the "Food" category).

If a student wishes to view a summary of their spending and/or income recorded in Degree Dollars to date, they may do so via the "See my History" feature.

Many students must pay student loans after they graduate. Degree Dollars helps students come up with strategies for paying them off. Using the "Loan Payment Planner" feature, a student can enter the total amount owed, the interest rate on the loan, and one of the following:
1. The amount they plan to spend on the loan each month, or
2. The number of months within which they hope to pay the loan in full
If the student enters item (1), Degree Dollars will calculate item (2) for them, and vice versa.

Degree Dollars will have the following features:
* Sign Up/Log In
  - Student can create a Degree Dollars account that they can then log into in the future; this allows the student's budget data to be accessible accross several of their devices
* Budgeting
  - Student enters planned spending amounts in several different subcategories prior to beginning of month
* Spending/Income
  - Throughout the month, student records actual spending in the various categories (these spending amounts are subtracted from the budgeted amounts accordingly)
  - Student may also add income to subcategories of their choosing
* See my History
  - Produces list of student's spending/income to date
* Loan Payment Planner
  - Given total loan amount, interest rate, and either (1)-planned monthly payment or (2)-number of months to pay in full, calculates (2) if (1) is entered, and (1) if (2) is entered

# Anticipated Technologies

* Degree Dollars will be written using the Python coding language and the [BeeWare](https://beeware.org/) development suite.
* User data (i.e., account information, budget information, and transaction history) will be stored using a MySQL database.
* Figma will be used for application prototyping (i.e., creating Degree Dollars "mockups").
* Jira will be used to create a KANBAN board for our project.

# Method/Approach

Our team will be using a combination of the iterative and parallel process flows. We will have one team member working on prototyping in Figma while the others are iteratively working on implementation in Python. We will group features that have similar implementation which will allow for the prototyping member to be working on the next group of features while the implementation team works on the previous group. Upon completing all prototyping in Figma, the prototyping member will begin working on integrating the MySQL database with the Python script. Then, they shall join the implementation team in developing and testing the app.

Our method/approach also utilizes elements of Agile: we will hold regular SCRUM meetings, and keep a KANBAN board in Jira.

# Estimated Timeline

* Implementation team will finish BeeWare tutorial by February 11th
  - Prototyping team will finish BeeWare tutorial by February 18th
* Figma prototyping of all features will be completed by March 13th
* The MySQL database will be integrated with the main Python script for the app by March 20th
* Implementation team will complete and manually test the "Budgeting" feature by March 27th
* Implementation team will complete and manually test the "Spending/Income" feature by April 3rd
* Implementation team will complete and manually test the "See my History" feature by April 3rd
* Implementation team will complete and manually test the "Loan Payment Planner" feature by April 10th
* Implementation team will complete and manually test the "Sign Up/Log In" feature by April 16th
* 2 team members complete deployment of app by April 16th
  - Other 2 team members create final presentation by April 16th

# Anticipated Problems

Our team name ("The Four Corners") was initially proposed because of the fact that all four of us are pursuing different fields of study. Thus, we all have different experience levels with coding, and not all of us are fluent in Python and SQL. Certain team members may not be as quick and effective in coding as others, which may be a challenge.

Additionally, we are all new to the BeeWare development suite. Fortunately, BeeWare offers a [tutorial](https://docs.beeware.org/en/latest/) on how to use it properly. However, our team is likely to experience some technical difficulties.
