# Introduction

College students must cover a variety of expenses both while they are in school (e.g., tuition, housing, textbooks, food/groceries) and after they graduate (primarily in the form of student loans). It would be highly beneficial if they had a quick and easy way to record their anticipated expenses before a given semester, track their actual cash flow (i.e., income and expenses) throughout the semester, and even come up with student loan payment strategies. Degree Dollars, developed by The Four Corners, provides these very services to both undergraduate and graduate students.

When coming up on a new semester, a student can use Degree Dollars to record the dollar amounts they plan to spend in a variety of categories, among which are "Tuition," "Housing," "Course Materials," and several others. These amounts would serve as the student's initial budget for the semester. Then, throughout the semester, the student can record their actual spending in each category. These spending amounts are automatically subtracted from the planned amounts. Should the student receive any income during the semester, they can also distribute any portion of that income across any categories they choose (e.g., the student receives $300.00; they add $100.00 to "Food/Groceries" and $125.00 to "Housing"). Of course, a student is not required to earn income in order to add money to certain categories of their budget. Degree Dollars allows students to add money to categories of their choosing whenever they want, and also transfer funds from one category to others of their choosing, thus making their budget dynamic.

If a student wishes to view a summary of their spending and saving habits to date, Degree Dollars allows them to do so via the "See my History" feature. Here, students may see how well they have done staying within their budget.

Many students must pay student loans after they graduate. Degree Dollars helps students come up with strategies for paying them off. Using the "Loan Payment Planning" feature, a student can enter the total amount owed, the interest rate on the loan, and one of the following:
1. The amount they plan to spend on the loan each month, or
2. The time frame within which they hope to pay the loan in full
If the student enters item (1), Degree Dollars will calculate item (2) for them, and vice versa.

In summary, Degree Dollars will have the following features:
* Budgeting
  - Student enters planned spending amounts in several different categories prior to beginning of semester
* Spending
  - Throughout the semester, student records actual spending in the various categories (these spending amounts are subtracted from the budgeted amounts accordingly)
* Add Funds
  - Throughout the semester, student may add funds to categories of their choosing
* Transfer Funds
  - Throughout the semester, student may transfer funds from one category to others of their choosing
* See my History
  - Produces summary of student's spending/saving activity to date
* Loan Payment Planning
  - Given total loan amount, interest rate, and either (1)-planned monthly payment or (2)-time to pay in full, calculates (2) if (1) is entered, and (1) if (2) is entered

# Anticipated Technologies

Degree Dollars will be written using the Python coding language and the [BeeWare](https://beeware.org/) development suite.

# Method/Approach

Our team will be using a combination of the iterative and parallel process flows. We will have one team member working on the planning and communication steps while the others are iteratively working on the modeling and construction steps. We will group features that have similar implementation which will allow for the planning member to be working on the next group of features while the development team works on the previous group.

# Estimated Timeline

(Figure out what your major milestones for this project will be, including how long you anticipate it *may* take to reach that point)

* Development team finishes BeeWare tutorial by February 11^{th}.
  - Planning team completes by February 18^{th}.
* Planning team will have structure in Figma complete by February 11^{th}

# Anticipated Problems

Our team name ("The Four Corners") was initially proposed because of the fact that all four of us are pursuing different fields of study. Thus, we all have different experience levels with coding, and not all of us are fluent in Python. Certain team members may not be as quick and effective in coding as others, which may be a challenge.

Additionally, we are all new to the BeeWare development suite. Fortunately, BeeWare offers a [tutorial](https://docs.beeware.org/en/latest/) on how to use it properly. However, our team is likely to experience some technical difficulties.
