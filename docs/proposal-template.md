# Introduction

(In 2-4 paragraphs, describe your project concept)
(Also define some loosely defined features of your project using bullet points)

College students must cover a variety of expenses both while they are in school (e.g., tuition, housing, textbooks, food/groceries) and after they graduate (primarily in the form of student loans). It would be highly beneficial if they had a quick and easy way to record their anticipated expenses before a given semester, track their actual cash flow (i.e., income and expenses) throughout the semester, and even come up with student loan payment strategies. [INSERT APP NAME], developed by The Four Corners, provides these very services to both undergraduate and graduate students.

When coming up on a new semester, a student can use [INSERT APP NAME] to record the dollar amounts they plan to spend in a variety of categories, among which are "Tuition," "Housing," "Course Materials," and several others. These amounts would serve as the student's initial budget for the semester. Then, throughout the semester, the student can record their actual spending in each category. These spending amounts are automatically subtracted from the planned amounts. Should the student receive any income during the semester, they can also distribute any portion of that income across any categories they choose (e.g., the student receives $300.00; they add $100.00 to "Food/Groceries" and $125.00 to "Housing"). Of course, a student is not required to earn income in order to add money to certain categories of their budget. [INSERT APP NAME] allows students to add money to categories of their choosing whenever they want, and also transfer funds from one category to another, thus making their budget dynamic.

[TODO: Explain the "Analyze Spending Habits" feature of the app]

Many students must pay student loans after they graduate. [INSERT APP NAME] helps students come up with strategies for paying them off. Using the "Loan Payment Plan" [name subject to change] feature, a student can enter the total amount owed, the interest rate on the loan, and one of the following:
1. The amount they plan to spend on the loan each month, or
2. The time frame within which they hope to pay the loan in full
If the student enters item (1), [INSERT APP NAME] will calculate item (2) for them, and vice versa.

In summary, [INSERT APP NAME] will have the following features:

# Anticipated Technologies

(What technologies are needed to build this project)
[INSERT APP NAME] will be written using the Python coding language and the BeeWare development suite.

# Method/Approach

(What is your estimated "plan of attack" for developing this project)

# Estimated Timeline

(Figure out what your major milestones for this project will be, including how long you anticipate it *may* take to reach that point)

# Anticipated Problems

(Describe any problems you foresee that you will need to overcome)
Our team name ("The Four Corners") was initially proposed because of the fact that all four of us are pursuing different fields of study. Thus, we all have different experience levels with coding, and not all of us are fluent in Python. Certain team members may not be as quick and effective in coding as others, which may be a challenge.

Additionally, we are all new to the BeeWare development suite. Fortunately, BeeWare offers a tutorial on how to use it properly. However, our team is likely to experience some technical difficulties.

Remember this is a living document is expected to be changed as you make progress on your project.
